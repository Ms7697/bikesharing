# bikesharing challenge

## Objective:
This challenge is about convincing the clients that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. For this analysis, using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, creating a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
* Finally, adding these new visualizations to the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
